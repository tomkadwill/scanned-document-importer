## Plan

The aim of this project is to upload scanned images (from OneDrive), convert them into the appropriate format and then
move them into the correct folder.

For example, if I import a tax return, then the importer should convert it into a PDF, give it the correct name and then
move it into the tax directory.

Initially the project will ask questions to the user in order to move things into the correct place. Eventually, I want
to expand this program to use A.I to determine which actions to take.
